## 🥗 Problem

- 1 in 4 children under 5 eat from only two food groups.
- Malnutrition becomes **chronic** past age 6.
- Less than 20% of children in low-income countries get meal support.

Existing solutions **don’t speak to the child**, don’t let them understand or choose.

PlanEat does — through a warm, intuitive AI experience.

> One meal can change everything. Let the kids choose. Let them understand.

## 🍽️ What is PlanEat?

**PlanEat** is an AI-powered nutrition coach designed especially for **children facing food insecurity**.

Instead of just giving calorie counts, PlanEat **understands the child’s real situation**—like allergies, ingredients at home, BMI, and cooking skill—to recommend the most suitable meals.

Log in with Google, track your meals, and receive AI-powered suggestions to improve your daily nutrition!

It features:

- 🧠 **Gemma**: A child-friendly explainer that uses warm, simple language to help kids understand **why** a meal is recommended.
- 💬 **Gemini**: A smart chatbot that answers questions like “How do I cook this?” or “Why do I need iron?” and guides them to food banks or recipes.

> Kids don’t just eat — they understand and choose.

PlanEat transforms traditional school meal and nutrition apps—often limited by lack of accessibility and autonomy—into a system where children **understand and choose their meals** through child-centered input and an AI explanation system.

We are aligned with **UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger**, aiming to address **child hunger and malnutrition** around the world.

In the future, we aim to expand **local food data and language support**, focusing on countries with a high concentration of children in low-income communities.

By integrating with **WFP’s food security programs**, PlanEat will grow into an **international standard platform** that can be used by both public institutions and caregivers.
